          catch them off guard, or directing shots towards their weaker side.

          make split-second decisions and stay composed under pressure. It
          requires adaptability and the ability to adjust ones tactics based on
          the opponents playing style and weaknesses. Tennis matches are
          typically played in sets, with each set consisting of games. The first
          player or team to win a specified number of sets wins the match. Major
